# Active Directory Home Lab

## Project Overview
<p>Managing and organizing resources in Active Directory is one of the most important skills I was able to develop during my time as a service desk technician.
The only hurdle I encountered then was not having enough time on the job to become efficient, quicker. 
<br><br> 
So, in the spirit of continuous learning, I created my own enterprise-level Active Directory home lab that allowed me to practice some of the skills I would use at the service desk, along with a few skills
(like linux ðŸ¤“) that would become useful later in my career.</p>
